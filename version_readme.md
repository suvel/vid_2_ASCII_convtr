# Version 0.1.0

Im excited ðŸŽ‰ to deploy my first version of the application. The codebase and dependency are a mess right now, will be cleaned up (Hopefully! ðŸ¤ž) in the next version with realtime conversion feature.

## To run the application
Go to root directory:-
1. install dependency:
`
npm i 
`
1. place the video in the input folder
1. start the application : `node index.js`

  ðŸ’¡ To ternimate/force stop the process use `cmd + c` (windows)

## My Experice on working with a Language Modal

I had been using Chatgpt-3 to deploy this version successfull. The only hurdule for was that the solutions/answers where relavent to the old versions of the dependcy , probabaly in the next version development I will be using Chatgpt4, hoping it might make my process esier.
